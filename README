libgraph is a small and relatively fast C graph library
developed in late 2005/early 2006 for the Algorithms and Data Structures
exam at the University of Trento.

I was recently in need of a tool to compute the betwenness centrality index
on a graph and thus I resumed it and decided to release it under the terms of a
BSD license.

The code is quite old and a bit far from my current style, but still does its job
for me.

Comments are mainly in Italian but that will be fixed (hopefully) soon.
