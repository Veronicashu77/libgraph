== About ==

libgraph is a small but relatively fast C graph library
developed in late 2005/early 2006 for the Algorithms and Data Structures
class at the University of Trento.

I was recently in need of a tool to visualize and compute the betwenness centrality index
on a large graph and I resumed this and decided to release it under the terms of a
BSD license.

The code is quite old and a bit far from my current style, but still does its job
for me.

Comments are mainly in Italian. Hopefully I will fix this soon.

== Betwenness Centrality ==

run `make bc` to build a small utility able to calculate the betwenness centrality
of nodes.

To usage info just run:
$ ./bc -h

Graphs can be loaded from CSV files and an option is given to store them in DOT format.
